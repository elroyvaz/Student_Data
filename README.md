# Student_Data

### Introduction
Welcome to the Data Analyst Read-Me file! This repository contains a project focused on analyzing student data using Excel. The project enables users to import a file, visualize data using different charts, compute statistics, and generate a Word document summarizing the results. 

### Sections:

1. **Data Import and Visualization** 📊
   - The project begins by importing student data from an Excel file.
   - It then creates visualizations such as bar graphs for each course to display student grades.

2. **Data Analysis** 📈
   - After importing, users are prompted to choose a specific course to analyze.
   - The program calculates statistics including minimum, maximum, and average grades for the selected course.

3. **Report Generation** 📝
   - Finally, the project generates a Word document summarizing the analysis results for the chosen course.


### 1. Data Import and Preparation
- The project begins by importing a dataset containing student data in Excel format.
- Two main sheets are created: "courses" and "grades".
- The "courses" sheet contains information about different courses offered.
- The "grades" sheet contains student grades for each course.

### 2. Data Visualization
- Upon importing the data, various charts are automatically generated to provide visual insights into the student data.
- Charts include bar graphs, scatter plots, or any other appropriate visualizations based on the data characteristics.

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Users are prompted to choose a course from the available options.
- After selecting a course, the system calculates key statistics such as minimum, maximum, and average grades for that course.
- These statistics are displayed to provide a quick overview of the course performance.

### 4. Report Generation
- Finally, a Word file is generated or opened, containing a detailed report of the analysis.
- The report includes the selected course's statistics, visualizations, and any other relevant findings.
